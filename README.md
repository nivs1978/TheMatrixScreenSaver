# The Matrix screen saver

C# Screen Saver WinForms application that simulates the matrix rain from the movie.

## Inspiration

Inspiration from this detailed article was used to make it look and behave more like the original: [Digital Rain Analysis by Carl Newton](https://github.com/carlnewton/digital-rain-analysis).
The application uses GDI+

## Features

- [ ] Matrix rain effect
- [ ] Customizable settings
- [ ] CRT shader effect (future enhancement, but would require using 3D graphics card instead of CPU for rendering)

## Installation

Publish to single self-contained executable, rename the .exe to .scr and copy to c:\Windows directory. Then you can set it as your default screen saver.
